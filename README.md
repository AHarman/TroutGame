# Tilly the Trout

This is a game created in co-ordination with the Bristol Avon Rivers Trust, intended to teach children about issues that affect our rivers and the wildlife within them.

You can play the game either on the BART website [here](http://www.bristolavonriverstrust.org/tilly/) or, if that link doesn't work, on the github page [here](http://aharman.github.io/TroutGame/)
